      "Text": "Developers’ notes: Through the first week of Season 3 Mythic+ dungeons, data and feedback suggest that Murozond’s Rise, Throne of the Tides, and Atal’Dazar are outliers in terms of difficulty. While Murozond’s Rise and Throne of the Tides are too difficult, Atal’Dazar is proving too easy and may affect player progression through the content in a negative way. Our adjustments aim to better align overall balance across the Mythic+ dungeon pool for Season 3."

      "Text": "Developers' note: Assassination is known for having strong single target damage, but has two areas of concern we hope to address in Guardians of the Dream. First and foremost, their AoE has been notably weak and left them far behind the pack for dungeons and certain raid encounter types. Secondly, Assassination's damage performance does not improve at a similar rate compared to most specs when players improve their play and coordination to take on bigger challenges, like when moving from Heroic to Mythic level raiding. For the first concern, we hope the changes here will raise the floor of Assassination's AoE and that it will feel like a distinct Assassination-like way to deliver AoE damage. As for the second concern, it's very important to us that we not completely rewrite the book and threaten to undermine what makes Assassination appealing for so many players from both fantasy and gameplay perspectives. With that in mind, the changes aimed at addressing this issue are more subtle. We hope to have created more room for players tackling high-end content to use their resources and encounter knowledge to get improved performance outcomes, while not increasing the number of hoops players at all levels need to jump through to get results similar to the past."

Talent gameplay outcomes have been mostly good during Dragonflight, but many talents are underused, and rigid pathing with insufficient connections have restricted talent options. We have changed, redesigned, and added new talents alongside improvements to pathing and interconnectedness that we hope will add up to feeling like there is more gameplay diversity and flexibility in the tree. We also recognize there have been some negative trends which we hope to address. To start, Subtlety's Energy and combo point resource economies have been overflowing, which creates a cascade of issues. Uptime for key cooldowns (predominantly Shadow Dance) has also been higher than expected, reducing the relative impact of those effects, which is troublesome for a spec that is known for having moments of increased intensity and burst within those cooldown windows. So, in addition to the more general improvements and additions for talents, Subtlety has received changes that affect Energy and combo point flow to increase the relative value of effects that temporarily offer more resources."
