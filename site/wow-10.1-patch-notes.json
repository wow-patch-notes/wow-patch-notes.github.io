We’re equalizing New Moon and Fury of Elune a bit and easing up on the importance of entering Eclipse with a Nature’s Grace change.

We are increasing the damage to your core melee attacks, which will boost your damage up to compensate for the tier set value adjustments and make your damage profile less reliant on the Dragonflight set bonuses.

This is very much like an adjustment that was made just before the launch of Dragonflight, and it's for the same reasons.\n\tWhen damage mitigation abilities and healing are too strong relative to player health, the only way to threaten players is to make enemy damage very high and spiky. If healers can very quickly top off their teammates and mana isn’t a limiting factor, enemies have to be tuned to have the capacity to do burst damage that kills players before healers can react. That isn’t very satisfying gameplay. Increasing player health gives players more time to react to incoming damage, and it makes players’ choices about cooldowns and mana management more meaningful.\n\tAlong with this change, you'll see several adjustments to hybrid healing spells, items, and enchantments, as well as percentage-based healing spells."

That level of variance between results on healing out of your direct control wasn’t healthy for the specialization. Our goal is to land somewhere in the middle – a single Rising Sun Kick likely shouldn’t save an ally on its own, but it also shouldn’t condemn them either. This new design is more dynamic and capable of handling a variety of healing profiles, and we feel will offer greater reliability for Mistweaver’s consistent healing. Additionally, with a redesign of Ancient Teachings that is more focused on group-wide healing, we are adjusting Vivify’s healing profile slightly to increase Mistweaver’s spot healing."

We knew that we wanted to bring its power back on the season boundary, but was important to us that player's investment in acquiring the item or the recipe was respected. Rather than reduce its power directly, we opted to redesign the passive to bring it in line with all other Jewelcrafting effects by scaling an axis of power with the quantity of gems slotted. The net result is that the Elemental Lariat will be less powerful than it is now earlier in a player's gearing phase, while preserving its place as a throughput powerhouse when players begin to round off their gear set with added sockets."
