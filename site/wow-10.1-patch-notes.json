There is no longer a hidden rule preventing a target from being spread to multiple times in a short period.\nWhen a Fiery Brand successfully spreads to a new target, the duration of the spread will always be 10 seconds, regardless of the original or remaining duration of the source it spread from."

This is very much like an adjustment that was made just before the launch of Dragonflight, and it's for the same reasons.\nWhen damage mitigation abilities and healing are too strong relative to player health, the only way to threaten players is to make enemy damage very high and spiky. If healers can very quickly top off their teammates and mana isn’t a limiting factor, enemies have to be tuned to have the capacity to do burst damage that kills players before healers can react. That isn’t very satisfying gameplay. Increasing player health gives players more time to react to incoming damage, and it makes players’ choices about cooldowns and mana management more meaningful.\nAlong with this change, you'll see several adjustments to hybrid healing spells, items, and enchantments, as well as percentage-based healing spells."

That level of variance between results on healing out of your direct control wasn’t healthy for the specialization. Our goal is to land somewhere in the middle – a single Rising Sun Kick likely shouldn’t save an ally on its own, but it also shouldn’t condemn them either. This new design is more dynamic and capable of handling a variety of healing profiles, and we feel will offer greater reliability for Mistweaver’s consistent healing. Additionally, with a redesign of Ancient Teachings that is more focused on group-wide healing, we are adjusting Vivify’s healing profile slightly to increase Mistweaver’s spot healing."

We have several changes coming to Shadow Priest Talents in Embers of Neltharion that are aimed at addressing spec issues and adding new Talent options. \n\nButton bloat: Shadow has more rotational abilities than most other specializations. We’re working to reduce this by having Mind Spike replace Mind Flay and removing Mind Sear.\nMind Sear: We feel Mind Sear as a spender was a worthy experiment in Dragonflight, but the gameplay has not been as smooth as we envisioned. We are removing the spell and focusing Shadow’s AoE kit further on Psychic Link.\nFlooded rotation: There are times in the rotation where several spells are competing to be cast due to proc frequency and overall Insanity generation. We are adjusting some proc and the Insanity generation of several talents for a clearer rotational flow.\nLack of distinct builds: With updates to existing talents and some new talents, we aim for more build-defining choices such as investing in cooldowns, damage over time effects, critical damage, or Shadowy Apparitions.\nPvP: In Dragonflight, Shadow has had access to more instant cast spells through procs and cooldowns than ever before. Because it was difficult to prevent Shadow Priests from scoring kills, we reduced their damage in Season 1. We’ve removed some of the problematic procs and cooldowns moving into 10.1.0, so there is more counterplay to Shadow’s offense. This allows us to ease up on some of the damage nerfs to the spec."

We knew that we wanted to bring its power back on the season boundary, but was important to us that player's investment in acquiring the item or the recipe was respected. Rather than reduce its power directly, we opted to redesign the passive to bring it in line with all other Jewelcrafting effects by scaling an axis of power with the quantity of gems slotted. The net result is that the Elemental Lariat will be less powerful than it is now earlier in a player's gearing phase, while preserving its place as a throughput powerhouse when players begin to round off their gear set with added sockets."
