There are some talents that warriors have for protection against these threats, like Disrupting Shout, Bolster, or Battle-Scarred Veteran, but it can be difficult to find the talent points for them. To provide more build flexibility we are reducing the power of the Battering Ram talent and moving its damage and defensive benefits into core abilities. We’re also increasing damage across the board and buffing some defensive talent options."
