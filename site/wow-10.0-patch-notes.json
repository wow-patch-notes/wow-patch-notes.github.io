But at the very high end of the system, we've heard feedback that sometimes the surest path to further incremental Rating increases lies in seeking out keys a group may have no hope of clearing within the timer. We don't want to change the way the system works for the vast majority of players who are working their way towards new Valor upgrade tiers, or cosmetic unlocks, but past the Mythic 20 threshold, there are no further tangible rewards other than the leaderboards and eventual end-of-season competition for the Thundering Hero title. The goal of this change is thus to ensure that the way to climb the leaderboards and earn a title meant for the best Mythic+ players in the world is by successfully completing dungeons within the allotted time, without negatively impacting the majority of players using the system. When this change takes effect, some players who are just barely at 2400 rating, with some of that rating coming from untimed 21+ keys, may drop below 2400 and need to re-earn that Rating in order to continue to upgrade new items to Rank 13."

However, it is clear that the gameplay did not support the fantasy and instead resulted in mostly frustrating experiences. These adjustments are intended to address many of those pain-points while maintaining the feeling of progressive mastery. While we will not be sharing exact values, we would also like to clarify that an Engineer with all 4 Safety specialization nodes and a Quality 3 tinker will reach the maximum success chance and do not need to use the Calibrated Safety Switch optional reagent. We will look for opportunities to make this system more transparent in future patches. Thank you all for your feedback!"
