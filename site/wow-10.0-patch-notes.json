But at the very high end of the system, we've heard feedback that sometimes the surest path to further incremental Rating increases lies in seeking out keys a group may have no hope of clearing within the timer. We don't want to change the way the system works for the vast majority of players who are working their way towards new Valor upgrade tiers, or cosmetic unlocks, but past the Mythic 20 threshold, there are no further tangible rewards other than the leaderboards and eventual end-of-season competition for the Thundering Hero title. The goal of this change is thus to ensure that the way to climb the leaderboards and earn a title meant for the best Mythic+ players in the world is by successfully completing dungeons within the allotted time, without negatively impacting the majority of players using the system. When this change takes effect, some players who are just barely at 2400 rating, with some of that rating coming from untimed 21+ keys, may drop below 2400 and need to re-earn that Rating in order to continue to upgrade new items to Rank 13."

      "Text": "[With weekly restarts] Aspects of Tinker and Bomb malfunctions have been redesigned or retuned:\n\nSafety Component optional reagents are now always discovered when Tinkers malfunction.\nSignificantly reduced the damage dealt from explosion malfunctions.\nSuccess chance no longer scales with Engineering Skill. The amount this granted has been made baseline.\nSuccess chance granted from casting item quality has been halved, the amount lost has been made baseline.\nSuccess chance granted from Specialization nodes has been doubled.\nMaximum amount of success chance for Engineers remains unchanged. Non-engineers can achieve a slightly higher value than previously.\nTinker: Arclight Vital Correctors now has a slight bonus to success chance for Engineers, with its maximum success chance equal to the Shadowlands variant.\n\nDevelopers’ note: There are multiple avenues of progression to increase your gadget success chance in Dragonflight, and the difference between a newbie Engineer and an experienced tinker is substantial. However, it is clear that the gameplay did not support the fantasy and instead resulted in mostly frustrating experiences. These adjustments are intended to address many of those pain-points while maintaining the feeling of progressive mastery. While we will not be sharing exact values, we would also like to clarify that an Engineer with all 4 Safety specialization nodes and a Quality 3 tinker will reach the maximum success chance and do not need to use the Calibrated Safety Switch optional reagent. We will look for opportunities to make this system more transparent in future patches. Thank you all for your feedback!"

In order to help address this we are increasing both the cost and damage of Frost Strike and Breath of Sindragosa. Maintaining a long breath can feel satisfying for many players but it can also feel disheartening when you lose it for reasons out of your control since so much of your damage becomes reliant on a very high uptime of Breath. The goal with this change is to bring the duration of Breath to a much more reasonable and compact window that allows you to deal the majority of your Breath damage in a shorter window."

      "Text": "Developers' note: Neltharax, Enemy of the Sky has been adjusted (see Items and Rewards section for details). The bow has a bonus effect on it that was intended to be a boost to the Hunter’s auto-shot damage when shooting a single target, and we still want to keep it that way. The special effect from the bow was not intended to also increase the melee auto-attack speed of any summoned pets. The power gain from this special Equip effect, in addition to its rarity, has made a pretty big divide between Hunters who have this bow, and Hunters who don’t. We’re changing the bow to have an equip effect that increases your auto-attack damage, rather than auto-attack speed. This auto-attack damage bonus will only affect you, the Hunter, and your own auto-shot damage – nothing from your pets will be increased from having this special bow. We recognize that the power gain of this bow was very large, and are tuning up some Hunter abilities to compensate for the changes made to the bow."

      "Text": "Developers' note: Retribution Paladin's have received a substantial rework in patch 10.0.7. We've rebuilt the Retribution talent tree from the ground up, so there are a large amount of changes to the talent tree, abilities, survivability and maneuverability. As a part of this we've tried to provide a broad set of talents that allow you to heavily invest in abilities that you personally enjoy, so that you can customize how you want to play and change your talents to meet the demand of the different types of content you want to engage with. We're excited to see how this plays out and we hope you enjoy our new take on Retribution Paladins!\nThe goals for the rework have been as follows:\n\nButtons: Retribution Paladins had a fairly large number of abilities, some of which we believe felt unnecessary and inefficient. We’ve worked to tone this down and have tried to provide Retribution Paladin's with a more focused set of abilities and cooldowns.\nStacking modifiers: There were many several talents and abilities that provided small stacking bonuses, which we believe made for a confusing and unpredictable playstyle. This led to periods of extreme burst damage, that in return would leave your core abilities feeling unsatisfying and under-tuned. We've significantly changed this and hope that your core abilities feel good and are powerful when used in all situations. This doesn’t mean we’ve reduced all elements of burst damage, but we hope to have provided more purposeful and deliberate periods of burst damage, while also allowing options that provide excellent sustained damage.\nSurvivability: Retribution Paladins have had one of the highest death rates across various forms of content. For a plate wearing class with hybrid healing, this hasn't felt feel right. We’ve strengthened Retribution Paladins significantly through a mixture of passive bonus and improvements to active abilities and cooldowns that should make them much more survivable.\nManeuverability: We recognize that there has been as issue here and we have made some improvements to allow make Retribution Paladins more mobile. We've also made some changes to allow Retribution Paladins to engage in combat more effectively from a distance that we feel helps compensate for a lack of mobility compared to some other classes."

The Darkglare will serve you for 20 seconds, blasting its target for Shadow damage, increased by 25% for every damage over time effect you have active on their current target.\n\nDevelopers' note: Darkglare has been increasingly difficult to tune due to how they scale in multi-target situations. To remedy this, we are changing how Darkglare scales so that they contribute more in single-target encounters. This should also increase the effectiveness of Grim Reach, emphasizing Darkglare as a powerful AOE option when talented."

By adding these crafted reagents to the Crafting Order system, we hope to offer more opportunities for crafters to locate and fill orders and customers to directly utilize their own materials to feel a stronger sense of ownership in the final product. Currently, multiple orders will need to be placed if you need a higher quantity than the recipe provides. We recognize that this flow isn't ideal and will be looking into how to improve it.

We knew there would be players on either extreme (or both!) of the luck spectrum but hoped we could offer enough recipes early that players could feel able to carve out their own niche, while steadily progressing toward a broader array of products long-term.
